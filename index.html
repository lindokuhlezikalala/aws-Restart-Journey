            <h2>TESTIMONIAL</h2>
            <blockquote>
                <h4><li><b>Thandie Khumalo</b></li></h4>
                <p>"I met Coach Zoe through my high school volleyball program. While working with
her, I found myself excelling in many different areas of my sport and increasing my
strength like crazy! I continued on to be a collegiate athlete and I wouldn’t have
been able to do it without her! She taught me how to lift properly while taking my
time and was the main reason why I know what to do in the gym without getting
injured! Furthermore, she is constantly preaching positivity into her clients while still
pushing them to do their best. Coach Lindsey is AWESOME and I would
recommend her to anyone in a heartbeat!" </p>

             <h4><li><b>Lerato Xulu</b></li></h4>
             <p>"Coach Zoe was honestly one of the best and most personable coaches I got to
experience and for that, I am forever grateful. Not only was she an inspirational
coach and individual but she was always pushing us to be our best by giving us
both fun and challenging workouts. She was always conscious of any injuries and
helped us prevent and heal them. Hands down one of the best out there and
always willing to help in and outside of training."</p>
